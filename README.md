# renovate-config

Shared [Renovate](https://docs.renovatebot.com/) presets for the workfloworchestrator repositories
(and related orgs such as BandwidthOnDemand). See [PLAN.md](PLAN.md) for the design and roadmap.

## Presets

Pick one preset per question: always the base, then the language, the project type, and any extras.
The base is `default.json` at the repository root; the rest live in folders named after the question they
answer.

| Preset | Use when | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `local>workfloworchestrator/renovate-config` | Always | Nightly schedule (22:00–06:00 Europe/Amsterdam), 3-day release age, Renovate merges only when all checks pass, GitHub Actions and pre-commit bumps automerge, action digests batched weekly |
| `…//languages/python` | uv / `pyproject.toml` | `uv` toolchain grouped weekly, `[dependency-groups]` proposed weekly and automerged, `requires-python` left alone |
| `…//projects/library` | Published to a registry (PyPI, npm, Maven) | Lock file maintenance automerges: users don't install from the lock file |
| `…//projects/application` | Deployed from the repo (image, `uv run`, bundled UI) | Lock file maintenance needs review: the lock file is what runs |
| `…//extras/release-notes` | Release notes are generated from PR labels | Adds `kind/dependencies`, `kind/ci` and `dev-dependencies` labels |

`…//path/name` is Renovate's syntax for "preset `name.json` in folder `path`"; see
[Preset File Naming](https://docs.renovatebot.com/config-presets/#preset-file-naming).

Main dependencies, extras and anything not listed above always need a review.

## Usage

Python library or tool:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://docs.renovatebot.com/renovate-schema.json",
  "extends": [
    "local>workfloworchestrator/renovate-config",
    "local>workfloworchestrator/renovate-config//languages/python",
    "local>workfloworchestrator/renovate-config//projects/library",
    "local>workfloworchestrator/renovate-config//extras/release-notes"
  ]
}
```

Python application:

```json
{
  "extends": [
    "local>workfloworchestrator/renovate-config",
    "local>workfloworchestrator/renovate-config//languages/python",
    "local>workfloworchestrator/renovate-config//projects/application"
  ]
}
```

JavaScript/TypeScript and Java/Scala (no language preset yet, see [PLAN.md](PLAN.md)):

```json
{
  "extends": [
    "local>workfloworchestrator/renovate-config",
    "local>workfloworchestrator/renovate-config//projects/library"
  ]
}
```

## Overriding

Rules in your own `renovate.json` come after the presets, so they win.

Keep a package that is in a dependency group *and* a runtime dependency or extra out of the weekly
automerge, and in the release notes:

```json
"packageRules": [
  {
    "description": "[automerge] Also a runtime dependency; review it and propose it nightly",
    "matchManagers": ["pep621"],
    "matchPackageNames": ["click", "sqlalchemy"],
    "automerge": false,
    "schedule": ["* 22-23 * * *", "* 0-5 * * *"],
    "labels": ["kind/dependencies"]
  }
]
```

Other common overrides:

| Goal | Setting |
|---|---|
| Let Renovate open security PRs (no Dependabot in this repo) | `"vulnerabilityAlerts": { "enabled": true, "schedule": ["at any time"], "minimumReleaseAge": null, "labels": ["kind/security"] }` |
| Different lock file maintenance day | `"lockFileMaintenance": { "schedule": ["before 3am on Wednesday"] }` |
| Skip the release age for your own packages | Package rule: `{ "matchPackageNames": ["nwa-stdlib"], "minimumReleaseAge": "0 days" }` |
| Ignore a file | `"ignorePaths": ["Dockerfile"]` |

Python repos: keep `[tool.uv] exclude-newer` in `pyproject.toml` equal to `minimumReleaseAge` (3 days).

### Required repository settings

Renovate can't approve PRs. If `main` requires reviews, add the Renovate app as a review-bypass actor,
otherwise automerge never happens.

## Contributing

A change on `main` applies to every repository at its next Renovate run. Run `prek run --all-files`
(CI does the same), and try changes on one repository first.

Every package rule's `description` starts with one tag: `[automerge]`, `[cooldown]`, `[disable]`,
`[group]`, `[labels]` or `[schedule]`.
